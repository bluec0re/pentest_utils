Target
======

execute shell cmds

Environment
===========

Script on the server takes your submitted name, saves it together with the
call "cowsay 'Hello <your name here>!'" encrypted in the cookie settings.

You've got two scripts:
1. test.php        generates the same content who is stored in the cookie
2. exploit.py      does the exploitation for you (with the right parameters ;-) )

Task
====

Choose a name which contains your system command (e.g. uname -a).
You will have to prepend enough data to your command, as this would be your IV 
which have to be modified.

Find the right position for the modification and what you want to have in the result.


Hints
=====

- the blocksize is 16 bytes
- shell commands could be terminated by a ;
- # is the comment character (prevents interpretation of the following characters)
- your supplied name is enclosed by single apostrophes
- CBC: IV xor intermediate data
